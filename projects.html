            <p class="card-text">This Python project was created by Omer Ahmer (me) and my partner Thomas Andrews and was for our
            Computer Science Principles class. This project spanned from March 4, 2019 to March 25, 2019. This project was my third experience
            programming in Python, after doing a Hangman and Text Adventure project. For this project, we had to choose from 4 clients each with
            different expectations in editing their photos. The client Thomas and I chose was the second client, the family. The client wanted
            "a standard frame applied to a large number of pictures that feature one or more of the family members. They want the composite image
            to be memorable and to incorporate some personalized symbol, image, or silhouette that represents the interests of the family member(s). 
            The client enjoys abstract art as well and might like to see geometric shape incorporated in the imageâ€”drawn on, as a border, or as a mask."
            My partner and I experienced many difficulties and setbacks because we had no immediate person to help us in our programming. However, towards
            the end, we were able to pull through the difficulties and created a product that we thought (and still think) met the expectations our
            client had. This project taught my partner and I how to solve problems using logic and help from our classmates instead of our teacher.
            I am especially proud of this project not only because of our end result, but that we were able to create a great result through all of the
            hardships we endured. We also learned a lifelong skill, which is being able to not give up and persevere. We also gained immense
            knowledge in Python libraries, especially libraries relating to image manipulation. Finally, we learned to consult our classmates in the
            rare case that we don't know how to get our result we desire.<br></br>

            <p class="card-text">This App Inventor Project was created by me and my partner Riya and was for our Computer
            Science Principles class. This project spanned from September 18, 2018, to October 5, 2018.
            For this project, we had to take an App Inventor original tutorial and modify it to make it our own. 
            This time, I had to take charge of the physics and visuals of the game, while Riya had to write the documentation.
            We chose to do Mole Mash, since there were many things we could change. For our beta version, we added
            a pause, play, and reset button. We also added a mole which you were not supposed to touch, which was a picture of
            Mr. Brown. We had a few bugs, such as the moles overlapping and the play button refusing to work. We
            got feedback from our friends, and they said we had to fix some minor bugs they noticed and add some more of our own functions
            to make it more unique. To do that, we also added a slower and faster button so the moles move at different
            speeds. Also, we got rid of the fixed holes so that the moles could move freely on the screen and would
            never overlap. From this project, I learned how to take lead of a project and help my partner understand how everything
            works. I also learned how to take feedback and turn it into useful work, and lead by example. <br></br>
