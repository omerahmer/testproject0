              <p>Technology is the future of the world, and I have always been fascinated by it. My name is Omer Ahmer. I
              am 15 years old and I am currently a sophomore in Dublin High School. In the future, I would like to become a software engineer. To do this, I will
              take many computer-science-relevant courses inside and outside of school. These will further expand my knowledge of computers, programming,
              network architecture, etc. This is my career choice because the computer science field is growing very rapidly,
              and many opportunities are available. I am passionate about programming, especially in web programming with JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.
              <br></br>
              I am very knowledgeable in mathematics, English, and Chemistry. I have an A in all of these classes (as of March 2020) and
              I am able to explain these concepts very well. Also, I am a very responsible person because when I keep my promises,
              I answer for my own actions, and I am trustworthy. My achievements from high school include: taking Geometry
              over the summer of 2018, taking Spanish 3, Honors Chemistry, Precalculus, and completing a Linux Essentials course on Linux Academy. (all in tenth grade.)
              <br></br>
              From my experiences, I have learned how to manage my time wisely. For example, when I have to study for multiple
              tests all in one week, I cut down on how much I play videogames and how much time I spend on other activities.
              Taking Geometry over summer has taught me patience and perseverance. This is because although I had to spend
              5 hours everyday for 6 weeks of my summer break, I realized that it was worth it and it will help me in the
              future.
              <br></br>
              Some of my hobbies include: swimming, reading, playing videogames, and of course, programming. I find programming
              to be the most entertaining because you get to see different people's code and how they coded an application or a
              website. Also, it is very rewarding creating something from scratch, by yourself, especially if it was a difficult
              project.
